# Intended Feature List
A list of features which we would like to implement.

1. ~~Allow for both minimizing and maximizing functions.~~
2. ~~Scaling Mutation Levels.~~
3. ~~structured logging~~
4. async solver
2. progress bar
3. multi-processing.
4. Getter and setter for solver arg validation along with tests.
2. Pareto Fronts for multi objective optimization.
   * ~~sort method is done need to write tests and incorperate into solver.~~
   * write front sampler
 3. add constraint handling
3. Cache/Optimize scoring
3. Standard candidates for common problems.
4. rust backend for performance speed ups.
5. Hueristic search framework with neural network for choice selection. This may be split out into a seperate library.
6. keep track of running stats and make available after solution.
